        <h2>Life Experience</h2>
          <p>My path has been far from traditional. Some might even call it scattered. I've explored many disciplines and career paths and I'm excited to bring my perspective and intellectual curiosity to web development.</p>
          <p>My creative passion is music. I'm the lead singer, songwriter, and rhythm guitarist in a punk rock band called <a href="https://failsonsdc.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Fail Sons</a>. We're currently writing an album which we plan on recording in 2021. With my new web design skills I'm going to build us a website.</p>
          <p>At university I majored in American Studies. I worked as a teacher and researcher with the <a href="https://baltimoretraces.umbc.edu/" target="_blank">Baltimore Traces</a> project which helps to highlight the lived experiences of Baltimoreans and integrate UMBC students with the communities of downtown Baltimore.</p>
          <p>While working with Baltimore Traces I helped produced a 10 minute segment from a series of student publications that aired on the Marc Steiner Show, a local Baltimore radio show. The segment was called <a href="https://www.steinershow.org/podcasts/arts-and-culture/baltimore-traces-communities-in-transition-part-5-futures/" target="_blank">Futures</a>.</p>
          <p>I also worked a journalism internship for a blog and an alt-weekly column called Democracy in Crisis. I did a little website management for them with Squarespace. I wrote my a few articles for them which were published at the Washington City Paper and the Baltimore Sun. Examples of my writing can be seen below.</p>
