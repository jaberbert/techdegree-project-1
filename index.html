        <h2>My Story So Far</h2>
          <p>"I am a front-end web developer"</p>
          <p>Adding those words to my LinkedIn profile during the early Treehouse Techdegree lessons felt disingenuous at first, but also empowering as I settled into the idea. As an aspiring writer I would know, aspiring to be something is as good as daydreaming.</p>
          <p>I've had a lot of false starts, so as I check my code and make any final touches on <b>My Personal Profile Page</b> I'm feeling a deep sense of satisfaction. I'm imagining a runner in last place crossing the finish line of a race that's long been won, ecstatic and celebrating in his own personal victory bubble, while any onlookers left are confused why this straggler is so happy.</p>
          <p>I didn't follow the traditional path of a web developer. I've never studied computer science. My background is in the arts and humanities. I'm a writer, teacher, and musician with a newfound interest the creative applications of technology. I've worked in audio and video production, journalism, education, freelance writing, and now I'm moving into tech and web development.</p>
          <p>I see web design as a great opportunity to synthesize all my creative interests while also developing my technical skills. Designing a website feels like writing a screenplay, but for a singular idea, business, or blog.</p>
          <p>I'm excited to integrate my skills with graphic design, writing, and multimedia production with web development.</p>

        <h2>Coding Roadmap</h2>
          <p>Planning out a roadmap for my coding studies helps motivate me for the future while also reminding me to stay focused what I need to learn today.</p>
          <p>I plan on learning these languages, tools, and technologies over the next year:</p>
